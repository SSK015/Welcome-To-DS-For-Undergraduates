### What is Clustering?
That is to say, given a set of **points**, We can define **a concept of distance** between these points. Then, we group the points into **some number of clusters**, which is known as "ç°‡" in Chinese.  

#### distance : mainly Euclidean or Jaccard

### Why is Clustering hard?
- #### Too many dimensions: isolated points
